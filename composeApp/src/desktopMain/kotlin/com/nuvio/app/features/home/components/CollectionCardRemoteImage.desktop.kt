/**
 * Animated collection art, with the still shown first.
 *
 * The bytes are disk-cached, but decoding them is the expensive half: a 73-frame GIF measures at
 * ~700ms (`readPixels` is 60-80% of that, and it is inherent to the codec). Decoded frames live
 * only in heap, so every cold start paid that again and the card sat grey throughout.
 *
 * Upstream avoids the problem on desktop by rendering [staticImageUrl] *instead of* the animation.
 * This renders it *underneath*: the still is an ordinary image that decodes in milliseconds, so the
 * artwork appears at once and the animation replaces it the moment its frames are ready.
 *
 * [animateIfPossible] is a real switch, not a hint. It used to control only whether the still was
 * drawn underneath, so a surface that asked for no animation still downloaded and fully decoded the
 * GIF and then played it. Now it also decides the URL (see the caller) and, when the folder has no
 * separate still to fall back to, tells the decoder to hand back the first frame instead.
