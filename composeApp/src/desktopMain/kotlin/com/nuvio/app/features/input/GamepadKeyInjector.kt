/**
 * Turns a pad press into the keystroke the same action already has on a keyboard.
 *
 * The whole design rests on this: nothing downstream is told a gamepad exists. A synthetic
 * `KEY_PRESSED`/`KEY_RELEASED` pair posted to the AWT event queue runs the identical path a real
 * key does — `Component.dispatchEventImpl` hands key events to the focus manager, which runs every
 * registered `KeyEventDispatcher` (the player's, `Main`'s back-navigation one) and then delivers to
 * the focus owner, where Compose's `onPreviewKeyEvent` handlers see it. So every screen that is
 * already keyboard-navigable is pad-navigable with no change of its own.
 *
 * Known gap: with a text field focused, a button whose action resolves to a letter key (Search is
 * "S" by default) types that letter instead. Controller text entry needs an on-screen keyboard,
 * which is not part of this phase.
