    // So this names what to delete rather than what to keep. It used to be a keep-list over a walk
    // of the whole data directory, which also took the game library, Badges/, the open log file,
    // instance.lock and every machine-local store nobody had thought to add to the list.
    //
    // The list mirrors LocalAccountDataCleaner.wipe(): a store belongs here when the repository
    // that owns it is reset in memory there (or reads the store lazily, like the Continue Watching
    // enrichment cache), so memory and disk agree after sign-out. Stores whose repository keeps
    // its state in memory (the synchronization permissions, player and home-row settings) stay on
    // disk for the same reason.
