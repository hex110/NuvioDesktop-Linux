/**
 * The resolution a hero backdrop is worth decoding at, from the display it will be drawn on.
 *
 * Every hero path passes [NuvioDesktopImageScaling.Disabled], which was meant to say "do not run the
 * custom resampling painter on this". It also had the side effect of sending no size at all, and
 * `AsyncImagePainter` answers a request with no size resolver by applying `SizeResolver.ORIGINAL` -
 * so backdrops were decoded and cached at full source resolution. Measured over one live disk cache:
 * 13.1% of images exceed 1536 px and average 15.8 MB decoded, and 284 of them were 3840x2160 at
 * 31.6 MB each. Ten of those is an entire 327 MB memory cache.
 *
 * **Physical pixels, from [desktopDisplayMetrics], not `LocalWindowInfo.containerSize`.** That
 * distinction is the whole correctness argument here. On a 4K display at 200% scaling, AWT and the
 * window state both report 1920x1080 - a request sized from those would have the hero decoded at
 * 2304 px and then drawn across 3840 physical pixels, which is a 1.67x upsample and a visibly soft
 * backdrop. [DesktopDisplayMetrics.sizePx] is explicitly `bounds * transform.scaleX`, so it is the
 * real framebuffer size, and it is snapshot-backed and re-evaluated when the window changes monitor.
 *
 * Capping at the *display* rather than the window is deliberately conservative: a small window on a
 * large display then saves nothing, but no configuration can ever end up asking for less than it
 * draws. Softness on the largest image in the app is a much worse outcome than a missed saving.
 *
 * Both axes are sent because `ContentScale.Crop` resolves to `Scale.FILL`, which takes the *larger*
 * of the two ratios - a square size lets the short axis decide and reduces nothing at all.
 *
 * [HeroScrollScaleHeadroom] covers the parallax zoom, which reaches `HERO_SCROLL_MAX_SCALE` (1.3x)
 * as the hero scrolls away. Deliberately less than the full 1.3: at rest, where the image is
 * actually looked at, this is at or above 1:1, and the remaining ~13% upsample only ever applies at
 * the extreme of a transient zoom on an element moving off screen.
 *
 * Quantised so that dragging a window across monitors does not re-request per intermediate DPI.
 *
 * On a display whose own resolution matches the source there is nothing to remove and this correctly
 * becomes a no-op: a 3840x2160 backdrop on a 3840x2160 display is already 1:1. The saving is real on
 * 1080p and 1440p displays, where a 4K backdrop is being decoded at two to four times the pixels
 * that can ever be shown.
