 * viewport and came back (animated frames are not held in the memory cache the way a static bitmap
 * is, so scrolling away drops them entirely).

/**
 * How many bytes of *decoded* artwork to keep in memory.
 *
 * Coil only sizes this sensibly on Android. Its non-Android default is 15% of
 * `totalAvailableMemoryBytes()`, and on this platform that function returns a hardcoded 512 MB
 * literal rather than anything about the machine — so leaving it unset gave every Windows user
 * exactly **76.8 MB**, whether they had 8 GB of RAM or 128 GB.
 *
 * That is far too little for what an entry costs here. `NuvioAsyncImage` requests artwork at up to
 * 1536 px, so a TMDB `w500` poster is held at 500x750 (1.4 MB) and a landscape card
 * cut from an `original` backdrop at 1536x864 (5.3 MB) — roughly 55 posters, or 15 landscape cards.
 * A single 1440p Search or Library screen shows more than that, so the cache was being evicted
 * within one row and every scroll back paid a fresh decode (measured at 2.4-7.5 ms per poster)
 * followed by a fresh resample in the draw path.
 *
 * A fraction of the machine rather than a constant, for the same reason as the animation cache next
 * door in `AnimatedSkiaImage.desktop.kt`: these are decoded bitmaps whose real constraint is
 * physical RAM. 1% gives 327 MB on a 32 GB machine (~230 posters) and 164 MB on a 16 GB one, and
 * the floor keeps a small machine above the 76.8 MB it would otherwise have had anyway.
 *
 * This is separate from, and much smaller than, [IMAGE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES] — that one holds compressed
 * bytes on disk, which is not the resource that runs out here.

/**
 * How many artwork decodes may run at once.
 *
 * NUVIO-LINUX: Coil is left on its default decoder dispatcher, which is
 * `Dispatchers.IO` -- a 64-thread pool. Entering the home screen prefetches on
 * the order of sixteen posters per collection row, so on a laptop that means
 * dozens of simultaneous full-size decodes (2.4-7.5 ms each, several MB of
 * bitmap apiece) against 12 hardware threads. The work is not just slow, it
 * arrives all at once: the CPU is oversubscribed and the allocation spike drives
 * GC, which this build makes more expensive by shrinking the heap aggressively
 * (-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30).
 *
 * Bounding it does not reduce the total work, it stops it being attempted
 * simultaneously -- the rows still fill, but the UI thread keeps its frames.
