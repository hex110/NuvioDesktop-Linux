 * literal rather than anything about the machine — so leaving it unset gave every Windows user
 * exactly **76.8 MB**, whether they had 8 GB of RAM or 128 GB.
 *
 * Artwork is decoded close to its physical display size. Keep the established browsing budget
 * for smooth back-navigation; DesktopArtworkCaches temporarily lowers it while playback or a
 * hidden window makes most of the artwork inactive. The animation cache owns its frames itself.
 *
 * This is separate from, and much smaller than, [IMAGE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES] — that one holds compressed

 * dozens of simultaneous full-size decodes (2.4-7.5 ms each, several MB of
 * bitmap apiece) against 12 hardware threads. The work is not just slow, it
 * arrives all at once: the CPU is oversubscribed and the allocation spike drives
 * GC, which this build makes more expensive by shrinking the heap aggressively
 * (-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30).
 *
 * Bounding it does not reduce the total work, it stops it being attempted
 * simultaneously -- the rows still fill, but the UI thread keeps its frames.
