/*
 * Playlist advance, run the way a binge next-episode advance is.
 *
 * The next entry's source is searched for inside the player, through the same
 * launchPlayerNextEpisodeAutoPlay pipeline (auto-play mode, source scoping, scoring, binge-group
 * preference, the empty-result retry, "Apply To Next Episode"), with the next-episode card showing
 * the search. Two ways in:
 *
 *  - [preparePlaylistAdvance] at the up-next threshold. With Binge Mode on it hands off as soon as a
 *    source is chosen, like binge; otherwise it only holds the result, so the end of the file (or a
 *    click on the card) plays the next entry immediately instead of starting a search then.
 *  - [requestPlaylistAdvance] at the end of the file, or from the card / next button / skip key.
 *
 * The handoff itself replaces the player route — see PlaylistHandoff for why it cannot be in place.
