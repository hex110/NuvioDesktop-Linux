 * @param staticImageUrl a non-animated cover for the same folder, when one exists. Desktop shows it
 *   immediately and swaps to the animation once its frames are decoded, because decoding a 73-frame
 *   GIF takes ~700ms and the card is otherwise blank for that whole time on a cold start.
 * @param playAnimation false holds an animated card on its first frame without leaving the
 *   animated path, so flipping it back on (focus-only playback) starts from the same picture.
