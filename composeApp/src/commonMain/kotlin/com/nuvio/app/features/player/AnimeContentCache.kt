package com.nuvio.app.features.player

/**
 * In-memory map of `parentMetaId -> what the metadata says it is`, populated when a meta detail
 * screen loads (where the title's genres are known) and read by the desktop player to decide
 * whether to auto-apply the anime enhancement preset.
 *
 * Nuvio Desktop has no online anime database like Stremio-Kai, so detection is genre-based, with
 * the title's provenance disambiguating a bare "Animation" tag (see [classifyAnimeContent]).
 * Callers pass the language/country they already hold: recording genres alone would silently
 * re-introduce the Western-cartoon over-match this cache exists to feed.
 *
 * What is stored is the classification, not the yes/no verdict. The "Include Western Animation"
 * preference is applied on read, so flipping it takes effect for titles already seen this session
 * instead of waiting for their metadata to be fetched again.
 *
 * Capturing detection here decouples it from the many playback entry points, none of which carry
 * genre metadata. Titles played without first opening their detail screen (e.g. some
 * continue-watching paths) simply won't auto-detect — the in-player F10 toggle still forces the
 * preset on those.
 *
 * Follows the same object-store pattern as [PlayerLaunchStore] / StreamLaunchStore.
