 * Support for replacing one player with another (playlist advance).
 *
 * Two players must never be composed at once: each owns a native mpv surface, and each one's
 * dispose clears process-wide flags (gamepad routing, screensaver guard, download pause, stream
 * prefetch parking) that the incoming one has just set. So the outgoing player is popped first, and
 * the next is only opened once [activeRoutes] says it has gone; the shield hides the gap.
