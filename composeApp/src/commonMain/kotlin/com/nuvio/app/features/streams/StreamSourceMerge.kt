 * Collapses every addon's section into one score-ordered list.
 *
 * Duplicates are the whole problem here: the same release is routinely offered by Torrentio, Comet
 * and Meteor at once, and AIOStreams aggregates those very providers, so a naive concatenation
 * sorted by score puts three or four identical rows back to back — identical releases score
 * identically, so they land adjacent and the list reads as broken.
 *
 * Kept pure and free of Compose so the dedup can be tested directly: this is the one piece of the
 * feature that can *remove* a row the user might have wanted, so it needs to be provable rather
 * than eyeballed.
